        <h3 class="h3one">About Me</h3>
        <p class="pone">I am studying MSc Computational and Data Journalism Student at Cardiff University. I completed a BA (Hons) Journalism degree with a 2:1 from the University of Winchester in May 2016 with BJTC accrediation. Despite studying a broadcast journalism
            degree, my passions lie in data visualisation and investigative journalism. In 2016, I won a BJTC award for innovative student media.<br><br> Take a look at some of my projects! </p>

        <h3 class="h3two"><a href="https://laurafharding.github.io/Actor-Search-App/index.html">Movie Search App</a></h3>
        <p class="ptwo">This app was a coursework project for the Web Application Development module on my course. I used JavaScript to code an API app that, when you search for an actor, returns their most famous movie and it's synopsis. It is hosted on Github.</p>
