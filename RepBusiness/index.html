  <h1>Snap Inc. - A company Snapshot</h1>
  <p>

With 158 million people opening Snapchat an average of 18 times per day, investors have been snappy – excuse the pun – to research this relatively young app to find out how successful their potential investments could be.<br><br>

	However, the allure of Snap and the way in which they have filed on the US Securities and Exchange Commission is not all it seems.<br><br>

	Having recorded a revenue of $400 million in 2016, they also recorded their net loss of $515 million which is an immediate sign of caution for prospective shareholders.<br><br>

	The value of Snap is estimated to be $18.5 billion which is impressive, however given that the original prediction was $25 billion, Snap’s losses and financial instability could really affect the sale of 200million 4 shares in its forthcoming IPO. <br><br>

	Business Insider reported that Goldman Sachs had predicted Snap’s 2018 revenue to be around the $2 billion mark, 3 which is interesting because Snap’s growth has drastically slowed down since its launch in 2011. <br><br>

	The app allows a user to send a receive pictures that last 10 seconds before deleting itself, as well as sharing public ‘stories’ that last 24 hours. The app is aimed at the smartphone-owning millennial generation. Since they started advertising and increasing how Snapchat users could interact with the app, it’s become more of a marketable, money making product. Usage shows no signs of slowing down but Snap needs to be sure that they’re not only maintaining their user base but developing it further. <br><br>

	Snapchat is dominant in the saturated selfie-app market, but with copy-cat features on other social media apps such as Instagram Stories and Facebook Live, the previously non-existent competition is suddenly beginning to heat up. <br><br>

	The issue for investors will be the uncertainty of how likely the app is to make money. The audience that uses snapchat aren’t necessarily a large consumer group. This means that the more expensive it becomes to advertise on Snapchat, the higher the possibility is that advertisers might see it as a redundant area in which to spend money. <br><br>

	It’s also worth considering that to maintain user activity and develop growth, Snap will be constantly investing and spending money, putting them at a risk of losses and plateauing – an unattractive prospect to those investing to make money.<br><br>

	This IPO has been extremely interesting thus far, partly due to the format in which they have proposed in their prospectus. Evan Spiegel and Bobby Murphy are to remain as majority shareholders, and will provide a voting system in regards to company decisions.<br><br>

	The odd thing about this is the way in which they intend to share votes. Spiegel and Murphy would each have 10 votes, and would own ‘C shares’. Early investors and employees would each get 1 vote: ‘B shares’ and then ‘A shares’ which will be the more general public would not get any votes. <br><br>

	This may be a very clever approach. On one hand, it would encourage investors to buy shares sooner rather than later so that they have some aspect of control. It essentially gets the ball rolling and gets the industry talking about Snap.<br><br>

	Secondly, having this kind of tier system means that the owners manage to enjoy protection from accountability whilst maintaining control. This is their personal insurance policy and also covers the employees and personal relations who are likely to be the holders of B shares. It’s an all-round protection scheme for everyone involved, except external investors. <br><br>

	The clause in the prospectus covers the resale of shares. B shares cannot be sold as votes, they will become A shares with no votes if they are sold on. Again, this keeps the owner’s accountability at minimal risk. <br><br>

	Luckily for Snap, they are able to propose this system because despite being publicly traded shares, they are still private property and Snap is an exciting enough product to have the audacity to suggest such a system.<br><br>

	Whilst it’s not quite Silicon Valley leagues quite yet, Snapchat is an app that has gone from strength to strength since it’s relatively recent launch in 2011. The marketable side of Snapchat is even younger again, but seems to be heading in the right direction.<br><br>

This week, they have just launched the general sale ‘Spectacles’ – glasses with cameras embedded in the frames so that the Snapchatting experience is even more interactive. Think GoPro + Snapchat, and you get the next development in the app. Sales of Spectacles are likely to boost the revenue, as up until now, the only aspect of Snapchat that the user might pay for was to buy Snapchat filters - a feature which didn’t last long anyway.<br><br>

 The important thing now for Snapchat and any other ventures into which Snap invest is to ensure that the fresh equity they have fills the gap between revenue and expenditure. As long as they keep up with the market and user interactivity, the more appealing it will become to advertise on Snapchat. <br><br>

Investors will be made aware that there is no intention to pay out cash dividends for the foreseeable future, but if Goldman Sachs’ prediction is accurate and Snap manages to be worth $2bn by this time next year, then investors will be very happy that they chose to have faith in Snapchat when they did. <br><br>
