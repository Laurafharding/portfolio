  <h1>"How should we report politics in a "post-truth" age"?</h1>

  <p>“Post-truth”: An abstract term that applies to the age in which we live. As the Oxford Dictionaries Word of the Year for 2016, “post-truth” goes hand in hand with politics to represent misleading claims and declarations from politicians which, naturally, become headline news.<br>
    <br>
  This has never been more prevalent than in Britain's Brexit campaign and America’s Clinton/Trump election. Both, we know, were dramatic, unpredictable and internationally recognised political affairs with surprising results.<br>
<br>
  “Post-truth” doesn’t necessarily refer to lies, but to a debate appealing to emotion rather than details of policy. Politicians publicly attacking each other on personal matters, rather than the opposing party’s campaign makes for a childish and often a factually-diluted debate that becomes devoid of the true argument at hand. In terms of voting results, we start to see opinions which rest on emotional preference to a person, rather than their manifestos.<br> 
<br>
  So the issue for journalists is how do we report politics in a “post-truth” age? Well, it seems that there is no correct answer. There is a strong argument for the media swaying the Brexit vote, partly due to news coverage of both campaigns which boasted largely inaccurate facts and claims.<br>
<br>
  But, if a reporter were to comment on the campaigns and say “This isn’t true”, at what point does the report appear to have a political bias?<br>
<br>
  This is a particularly big issue in broadcasting situations, as newspapers traditionally have their political sways, whereas the BBC, ITV and Channel 4, for example, must remain impartial.<br>
<br>
  So, if a campaigner or politician claims that £350 million a week will go to the NHS instead of the EU if the UK votes to leave, then there is little a broadcaster can do to disagree except for allow the opposition to have their say on air.<br>
<br>
  A similar issue arose in the United States, from the moment that Donald Trump announced his candidacy for the Republican party. A non-politician entering the biggest political race that there is. The story became one of novelty, with many Americans and a lot of left wing press failed to take Trump seriously, but the phrase ‘all press is good press’ clearly worked for Trump who went on to win not just the candidacy but the election.<br>
<br>
  When BuzzFeed released an unsubstantiated report on Trump shortly before his inauguration, the publication received a huge wave of criticism from not just Trump’s team and supporting Republicans, but from other media outlets.<br>
<br>
  The report alleged both politically and personally compromising information about the president elect, none of which was verifiable. As BuzzFeed are an online publication, the internet, namely Twitter, blew up with coverage, satire and speculation regarding the dossier, so naturally, other news platforms felt compelled to report on the dossier too.<br>
<br>
  As an unproven document, the report held no credibility, however the more attention it got, the less sceptical the public becomes. If every large, reputable news platform is reporting on a compromising list of claims about the senior political figure, then the perception becomes swayed and the idea that this is true fact is solidified, even if reporters are using the correct language to describe it’s credibility.<br>
<br>
  BuzzFeed’s statement regarding the release said: “Now BuzzFeed News is publishing the full document so that Americans can make up their own minds about allegations about the president-elect that have circulated at the highest levels of the US government.”<br>
<br>
  BuzzFeed were able to use the defence that the information and allegations within the dossier were in the public’s interest, but of course as an uncorroborated paper, there would be no way to prove it true or false anyway.<br>
<br>
  These recurring types of story make for huge obstacles for reporters. With Twitter acting as an overwhelmingly fast source of spreading news – whether this be true or false, reporters need to be more careful than ever with their fact checking.<br>
<br>
  Reporting on what a politician says or does is one thing, but being cautious enough to ensure a reporter balances the argument is a key.<br>
